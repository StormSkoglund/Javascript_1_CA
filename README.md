# HTML-and-CSS-CA

UPDATE: This is an updated version for the Javascript 1 CA. For this CA I have used different methods for making API calls and handling the errors that may occur in the process. The methods used is a combination between the ones demonstrated in the curriculum, and the ones shown to us in later class sessions and in demos handed to us during classes.

I have made comments in my javascript where these methods have been applied. Instead of deleting my hardcoded material in the HTML, I have commented out the code that needed to be generated by the API. This was done in order for me to prevent loss of important code along the way.
I have kept a screenshot from the "Super Duper" game, this was made for the original HTML and CSS CA, and it served as a graphical component and for layout purposes.

Hi.

These are the extra curriculum sources I have been using, as a way of getting un-stuck. I will post this message at the beginning of my CSS stylesheet, as a reference as well,
instead of citing these every time that these have sources have been in use during the coding process.

I would like to thank the people on the CSS and HTML thread for reviewing my code, when i was stuck and giving me a pointer in the right direction.

NB: I'm aware of some persistent errors about missing labels, I get them every time I am using the Wave tool in Firefox. I unfortunately haven't found a solution for this, even though I've been adding labels to different missing forms.
